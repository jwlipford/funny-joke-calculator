* 9 + 10
* 4 - 1
* 2 * 2
* 6 * 9

Other ways to trigger jokes:
* Addition or subtraction of integers containing 8 or more digits that are only 0 or 1
* An odd number minus one (if no other jokes is triggered by subtracting 1 from an odd number, this joke has a random chance of
  occuring)

* Result is one of several integers that, written in hexadecimal, spell "hex words" such as 0xACE
* Result is a power of 2 and result ≥ 2<sup>8</sup> = 256
* If no other joke is triggered, the calculator has a random chance of outputting a new addition or subtraction problem equal to the
  result of the user's operation
* If no other joke is triggered, the calculator has a very small random chance of outputting a link to a YouTube video
